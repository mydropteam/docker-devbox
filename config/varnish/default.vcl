# This is an example VCL file for Varnish.
#
# It does not do anything by default, delegating control to the
# builtin VCL. The builtin VCL is called when there is no explicit
# return statement.
#
# See the VCL chapters in the Users Guide at https://www.varnish-cache.org/docs/
# and https://www.varnish-cache.org/trac/wiki/VCLExamples for more examples.

# Marker to tell the VCL compiler that this VCL has been adapted to the
# new 4.0 format.
vcl 4.0;

# Default backend definition. Set this to point to your content server.
backend default {
    .host = "web";
    .port = "80";
}

sub vcl_recv {

    # Return (pass) instructs Varnish not to cache the request
    # when the condition is met.

    ## ADMIN PAGES ##

    # Here we filter out all URLs containing Drupal administrative sections

    ## BACKUP AND MIGRATE MODULE ##

    # It won't work with Varnish

    ## COOKIES ##

    # Remove cookies for stylesheets, scripts, and images used throughout the site.
    # Removing cookies will allow Varnish to cache those files.

    }

    # Remove all cookies that are not necessary for Drupal to work properly.
    # Since it would be cumbersome to REMOVE certain cookies, we specify
    # which ones are of interest to us, and remove all others. In this particular
    # case we leave SESS, SSESS and NO_CACHE cookies used by Drupal's administrative
    # interface. Cookies in cookie header are delimited with ";", so when there are
    # many cookies, the header looks like "Cookie1=value1; Cookie2=value2; Cookie3..."
    # and so on. That allows us to work with ";" to split cookies into individual
    # ones.
    #
    # The method for filtering unnecessary cookies has been adopted from:
    # https://fourkitchens.atlassian.net/wiki/display/TECH/Configure+Varnish+3+for+Drupal+7
    if (req.http.Cookie) {
        # 1. We add ; to the beginning of cookie header
        set req.http.Cookie = ";" + req.http.Cookie;

        # all cookies are delimited with no spaces.
        set req.http.Cookie = regsuball(req.http.Cookie, "; +", ";");
        # 3. We replace ";" INTO "; " (adding the space we have previously removed) in cookies
        # named SESS..., SSESS... and NO_CACHE. After this operation those cookies will be
        # easy to differentiate from the others, because those will be the only one with space
        # after ";"
        set req.http.Cookie = regsuball(req.http.Cookie, ";(SESS[a-z0-9]+|SSESS[a-z0-9]+|NO_CACHE)=", "; \1=");
        # 4. We remove all cookies with no space after ";", so basically we remove all cookies other
        # than those above.
        set req.http.Cookie = regsuball(req.http.Cookie, ";[^ ][^;]*", "");
        # 5. We strip leading and trailing whitespace and semicolons.
